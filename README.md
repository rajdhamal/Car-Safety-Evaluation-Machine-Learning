Performed Exploratory Data Analysis(EDA) on Car dataset. 
Trained and tested the model using two Machine Learning techniques: K-Nearest Neighbor and Random Forest Classifier.
Predicted the safety standards of the car based on various key factors and compared the accuracy of the models where Random Forest Classifier model had much higher accuracy than the KNN model.
